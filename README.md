# Homework Assignment 1

## Code Refactoring

This assignment asked us to refactor existing code to use semantic HTML elements, alt attributes for images and logical structure for the code. This made the HTML and CSS easier to read and gave alternate text for images in case it could not be displayed or if a user could not see the image.
